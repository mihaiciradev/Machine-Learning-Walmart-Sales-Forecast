# Machine Learning Walmart Sales Forecast
This project focuses on predicting Walmart sales during holidays using a dataset obtained from
Kaggle. We preprocess the data by merging datasets, handling missing values, and performing outlier
detection. Exploratory data analysis provides insights into average monthly sales and holiday sales
distribution. The Random Forest Regression algorithm is applied to model the sales data, and the
modelâ€™s performance is evaluated. The results aid in optimizing inventory management and marketing
strategies, contributing to improved sales forecasting in the retail industry.
